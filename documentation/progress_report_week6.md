# Progress Report Week 6

- Fixed path length calculation; diagonal movement costs $\sqrt{2}$ for all algorithms. Changed from Manhattan distance to the Euclidean distance function to suit this diagonal traversal.

- Converted the `PriorityQueue` class into a binary heap.

- Started work on real jump point logic for the JPS. Current work can be seen on the "realJPS" feature branch, "main" does not include these changes!

Hours spent: 10 h (course total 42 h)
