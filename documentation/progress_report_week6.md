# Progress Report Week 6

- Fixed path length calculation; diagonal movement costs $\sqrt{2}$ for all algorithms. Changed from Manhattan distance to the Euclidean distance function to suit this diagonal traversal.

- Converted the `PriorityQueue` class into a binary heap.

Hours spent: 4 h (course total 36 h)
