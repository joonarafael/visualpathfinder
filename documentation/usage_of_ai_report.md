# USAGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE & LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS

No modern programmer builds anything without the assistance of an AI.

Here I've collected a summary of some more major parts of the application that required the consulting of a large language model.

- **Jest Unittests**: AI helped initialize the first basic layout for a Jest test file.

- **Adjacency List Generation function**: AI assisted building approx. half of the function after I provided all the inputs and requirements for the function.

- **Dijkstra's algorithm**: AI helped convert my own Dijkstra algorithm slightly so it would take an adjacency _list_ as an argument as opposed to an adjacency _matrix_.
