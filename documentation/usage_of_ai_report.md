# USAGE OF AI & LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS

I've got _[Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/ "Tabnine Homepage")_ installed as a third-party plugin in my Visual Studio Code. It's a context-aware AI assistant for IDEs that autocompletes, suggests functions and generates blocks of code based on other code found in the file/project. This plugin, however, provides little to no help with any actual logic.

Additionally, here I've collected a summary of some more major parts of the application that required the consulting of a large language model.

- **Jest Unittests**: AI helped initialize the first basic layout for a Jest test file.

- **Adjacency List Generation function**: AI assisted building approx. half of the function after I provided all the inputs and requirements for the function.

- **Dijkstra's algorithm**: AI helped convert my own Dijkstra algorithm slightly so it would take an adjacency _list_ as an argument as opposed to an adjacency _matrix_. AI also helped by debugging the issues related to the creation of the `shortestPath` array.

- **A\* algorithm**: AI helped troubleshoot issues with the `shortestPath` reconstruction function. AI also helped debug issues with infinite A\* execution loops.
