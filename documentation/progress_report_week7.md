# Progress Report Week 7

- Fixed Dijkstra's algorithm to work like the required PQ implementation.

- Wrote much of the JPS algorithm implementation.

- Fixed old tests to suit the new diagonal Euclidean distance calculation.

- Added more documentation and commented the code.

- Added more quality-of-life updates to the interface.

- Added "virtual maps"; algorithms can now be tested on large non-interactive maps in a separate application layout.

Hours spent: 24 h (course total 66 h)
