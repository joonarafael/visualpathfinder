# USER MANUAL

This manual provides instructions for the [Live Application](https://visualpathfinder.vercel.app/ "Visual Pathfinder") running on the dedicated web server. If you're looking for the guide on how to clone this repository and get your own version running on your local machine, please consult [this document](https://github.com/joonarafael/visualpathfinder/tree/main/documentation/installation_manual.md "Installation Manual").

## General Performance Notice

The 72 \* 48 matrix is quite large (3456 individual nodes). Almost all of the application logic is run on the client machine by the client browser. Make sure you're running the latest version of your browser to ensure the best performance. The less wall tiles, the more possible paths for the selected algorithm to consider. If you're experiencing performance issues, try placing the start and end nodes closer together and increase the number of wall tiles.
